# Database Config File PHP

## What is try-catch?

The try...catch statement marks a block of statements to try and specifies a response should an exception be thrown.

## What is PDO?
PDO refers to PHP Data Object, which is a PHP extension that defines a lightweight and consistent interface for accessing a database in PHP. It is a set of PHP extensions which provide a core PDO class and database-specific driver. Each database driver can expose database-specific features as a regular extension function that implements the PDO interface.
